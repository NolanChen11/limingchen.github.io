            Machine-Learned Nature is an on-going project that aims to use machine learning models as a medium of
            information, converting one's surrounding nature into an artistic and digital representation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Rather than training the model on large datasets, using customized datasets might provide models that
            are more relevant to individuals. Thus, developing a workflow that allows one to easily collect data and
            train the model is an important topic of this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the installation I created for my Studio Art capstone project, I trained a pix2pix translation model
            using conditional GAN on the pictures of nature I took around my living place.

            To increase the number of instances, I divided the images into uniform smaller segments. Subsequently,
            employing morphological transformations and edge detection techniques, I generated processed images
            (labels) and retained the original cropped images as attributes within my dataset.

            The trained model can translate the black and white input to colorful "nature style". Thus, I programed
            some moving patterns in Processing, which represent the instances in my dataset --- stones, clouds,
            grass, branches, then applied the model to the pattern.
