            In this project, I worked with two group mates and co-designed a workflow
            that uses crowdsourcing to generate understandable graphic reading aid for
            each natural paragraph from narrative text.
            <br>
            <br>
            We noticed the linguistic and technological barriers around the world that prevent
            low literacy people from accessing key information. Thus, our goal is to build a cohesive system of human
            and computer to enhance global communication by helping low literacy people understand narrative text better
            at a low cost. At the same
            time, the system allows everyone, including those who don't have graphic desgin
            skills, to create graphic reading aids by summerizing, keywords marking, image collecting and collaging.

            Our research shows who are our stakeholders and their limitations when reading:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Low literacy</li>
            <li>Multiple spoken dialects & Multiple written languages</li>
            <li>Technological Barrier (no access to the internet, shared smartphones)</li>

            Workflow Overview
        </h1>
        <p class="text">
            We developed a workflow that collaboratively uses computer algorithms and human
            computation tasks to generate visual representations for each paragraph from narrative
            text. Our general workflow is:
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Split the narrative text into natural paragraphs.</li>
            <li>Summarize every paragraph.</li>
            <li>Mark Keywords from the summarization.</li>
            <li>For each summarized paragraph, collect images by keywords from the summarization and save them to an
                image set.</li>
            <li>Collaging the images into visual representations for each paragraph with the consistency of image
                selection.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

            Since we don't have the opportunity and budget to deploy this workflow to recruited
            workers on AMT, we simulate the results by assigning these tasks to the people around us. We
            used Google Docs as the platform for writing tasks (summarization, marking keywords)
            and Google Drive as the image set where people could save the images they collected.
            For the collaging task, we chose to use Photoshop to operate images
